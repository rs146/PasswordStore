PasswordStore
=============

PasswordStore Android App

This is an Android Application produced and authored by Rahul Singh as part of BlackCrowSystems. All code is copyrighted and
protected.

This Android Application stores and maintains a list of passwords that a user would commonly use. The difference of this
application to other applications is that it is a multi-user Android Password Storage application. It allows multiple users
to have their own user accounts to the application even though there is a master password to lock/unlock the Android Application.
An SQLite Cipher database is used within the application.
